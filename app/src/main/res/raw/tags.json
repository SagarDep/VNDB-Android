The name is a portmanteau of cybernetics and punk and was originally coined by Bruce Bethke as the title of his short story \"Cyberpunk\", published in 1983. It features advanced science, such as information technology and cybernetics, coupled with a degree of breakdown or radical change in the social order.\n\nCyberpunk plots often center on a conflict among hackers, artificial intelligences, and megacorporations, and tend to be set in a near-future Earth, rather than the far-future settings or galactic vistas found in novels such as Isaac Asimov's Foundation or Frank Herbert's Dune. The settings are usually post-industrial dystopias but tend to be marked by extraordinary cultural ferment and the use of technology in ways never anticipated by its creators (\"the street finds its own uses for things\").\n\n[From [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk]Wikipedia[/url]]","meta":true,"vns":47},{"vns":24,"cat":"cont","name":"Hime Heroine","description":"At least one of the heroines is an Eastern-style princess and is the daughter of a regional lord or the king - being called [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hime]hime[/url] by other characters is NOT enough to qualify a heroine for this tag.\n\nExamples include Sayo-hime of Amatsukaze and Hitoha of Ouzoku.","meta":true,"parents":[114],"id":295,"aliases":["Asian-style Princess Heroine"]},{"vns":34,"name":"Orphan Hero","cat":"cont","description":"One or more heroes in this game are [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphan]orphans[/url].\n\nAn orphan is a child permanently bereaved of or abandoned by his or her parents.
