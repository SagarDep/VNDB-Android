For example, they may often retort at the comical misunderstandings of the other characters.\n\nSimilar in execution to the concepts of \"funny man\" and \"straight man\" in double act comedy, boke and tsukkomi are a very important characteristic of manzai (Japanese style of comedy). Boke comes from the verb bokeru which carries the meaning of \"senility\" or \"air headed-ness\" and is reflected in the boke's tendency for misinterpretation and forgetfulness. The word tsukkomi refers to the role the second comedian plays in \"butting in\" and correcting the boke's errors. In performances it is common for the tsukkomi to berate the boke and hit them on the head with a swift smack; one traditional manzai prop often used for this purpose is a pleated paper fan.\n\nSee [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manzai]Wikipedia[/url] and [url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BokeAndTsukkomiRoutine]tvtropes[/url] for further reading.","aliases":[],"parents":[403]},{"id":341,"cat":"tech","vns":96,"meta":true,"description":"This game has an extra evil route that is mostly about rape, murder and all kinds of things that most people would not want to see.\n\nGood thing is, its all concentrated in a route so you can totally avoid it.\n\nUse this trait for games that are mostly about pure romances and such with one or more routes that are different than the rest and are filled with darker contents.","aliases":["Bad Route"],"name":"Evil Route","parents":[26]},{"parents":[1],"name":"Horror","description":"This game features elements and themes related to the [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_fiction]horror[/url] genre.","aliases":[],"meta":true,"vns":603,"cat":"cont","id":7},{"parents":[360],"name":"Trapped","aliases":["Trapped inside","Can't get out"],"description":"The game takes place inside a building or some kind of landform, from which the characters can't get out.","meta":true,"vns":217,"cat":"cont","id":293},{"meta":true,"description":"This game has considerable amount of scenes where one can see girl/girls who wears [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodystocking]bodystocking[/url].

Characters from movies and TV series represented by live actresses are becoming more common as less stigmatism is attached to violence being inflicted to women in media.
