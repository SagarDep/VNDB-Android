Waves suitable for surfing are found primarily in the ocean, but can be found in some lakes, in rivers in the form of a standing wave or tidal bore. Surfing can also be done in manmade sources such as wave pools and boat wakes. The term \"surfing\" refers to the act of riding a wave and not the form (with or without a board) in which the wave is ridden. For instance, the native peoples of the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such crafts on their belly, knees, and feet. Not to mention, Bodysurfing, the act of surfing a wave without a board, is considered by some to be the purest form of surfing. That much said, the more modern day definition of surfing tends to refer to when a surfer rides a wave standing up on a surfboard, which is referred to as stand-up surfing or paddleboarding. Although, another prominent form of surfing in the ocean today includes bodyboarding, which refers to when a surfer rides a wave either on the belly, dropknee, or stand-up on a bodyboard.

Belief in divine intervention in illness or healing is related to religious belief.

The elves were originally thought of as a race of divine beings (wights, vættir) endowed with magical powers, which they use both for the benefit and the injury of mankind. In medieval Norse mythology, they appear to have been divided into light elves and dark elves, difficult to delineate from the Æsir (gods) on one hand and the dvergar (dwarves) on the other.\n\nIn early modern and modern folklore, they become associated with the fairies of Romance folklore and assume a diminutive size, often living mainly in forests but also underground in hills or rocks, or in wells and springs. 19th-century Romanticism attempted to restore them to full stature making them men and women of great beauty. They were often depicted as very young, probably adolescents as male elves lack facial hair.\n\nFrom their depiction in Romanticism, elves entered the 20th-century high fantasy genre in the wake of the published work of J. R. R. Tolkien (especially the posthumous publication of his Silmarillion where Tolkien's treatment of the relation of light elves, dark elves and dwarves is made explicit).\n\nThis trait is intended to be used for LotR inspired elves that are human-like.

This information is usually of an embarrassing, socially damaging, and/or incriminating nature. As the information is substantially true, the act of revealing the information may not be criminal in its own right nor amount to a civil law defamation; it is the making of demands in exchange for withholding the information that is often considered a crime.","meta":true,"id":414,"name":"Blackmail","chars":213,"aliases":["Extortion"],"parents":[41]},{"id":1346,"meta":true,"name":"Old Type School Swimsuit","description":"This character can be seen in the \"[url=http://s.vndb.org/sf/34/60434.jpg]old type[/url]\" school swimsuit.\n\nThis type of swimwear began to appear in Japanese schools around the 1970s. Its color is usually dark blue, violet or black. There are also the Moe-versions like translucent or white, which is popular among the perverts, since the drenched white swimsuit becomes almost transparent.\nOld type school swimsuit has a distinctive front skirt. Unlike the very first version of the school swimsuit (so-called \"old old type\"), which consists of two separate pieces (panties and \"tunic\"), in this type of swimwear the back part of the panties is a continuation of the tunic, while the front part is sewn to the inner part of the tunic along two lines, as it shown in the picture. However, if desired, a small area above the pubis can be exposed. There are also might be the tags with the girl's name or class, which can be sewn to the frontside, backside or bottom of the tunic. Old type school swimsuit is mostly worn by girls of the junior or middle schools, although it can be worn by anyone.\n\nMore information can be found [url=http://kgtblog.seesaa.net/archives/201204-1.html]here[/url] and [url=http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/スクール水着]here[/url] (Japanese).","aliases":["School Classic Swimsuit","Former Type School Swimsuit","Old Type School Swimsuit","Skirt Type School Swimsit","Kyuusuku","Kyuu Sukumizu","Kyuugata Sukuuru Mizugi","Sukaato-gata Sukumizu","旧スク","旧スク水","旧型スクール水着","スカート型スク水"],"parents":[1197],"chars":521},{"aliases":["Double penetration dildo","Double headed dildo","Double dildo"],"parents":[1047],"chars":426,"meta":true,"name":"Double-ended Dildo","id":1526,"description":"This character is penetrated with a [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_penetration_dildo]double-ended dildo[/url] or vibrator.\n\nThis is a sex toy that allows for the simultaneous penetration of two people's orifices at the same time.
